## Foundation Final Assessment

* There are three sections. Answer three questions from each section.

* Read all three sections before you start writing answers.

* Each individual question answer should be in its own file.

* DO NOT SPEND ALL YOUR TIME GETTING STUCK ON ONE QUESTION, DO WHAT YOU CAN, MOVE ON, AND COME BACK

* I suggest that you answer the easiest problem in part 1, the easiest problem in part 2, the easiest problem in part 3, and then come back and do another problem in part 1, another problem in part 2, another problem in part 3, and then a final problem in each.

* There are special instructions if you are trying to exempt the Byte Academy full program entrance requirements.

* I will stay until 10:00 if anyone needs the extra time, but no later.

* There is partial credit and you do not need to score a 100 to pass.

* If you are really stuck on something that is not working for a reason you can't figure out, write text that describes how you think a solution would work. Coding is difficult and it takes different people different amounts of time to learn. I want to see that you've been learning, not that you've mastered every single thing yet.

* You can use any source of information other than talking to a person. I will clarify anything that is unclear, but I will not help you write code or fix bugs.

* Remember that your python file needs to be in the same folder as any files you are reading or writing.

* When you are ready to turn in your work, put everything in a .zip file and then send it to me *in a direct message, not in the Triad channel*.

* Good luck! It has been a pleasure teaching y'all!
