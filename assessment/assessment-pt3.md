## Foundation Assessment Pt. 3

Answer 3 of the following 5 questions.

For entrance exam exemption, you must answer the last two questions.

* Print the number of lines in tothelighthouse.txt. Include the blank lines in your count.

* Create a new text file that is the first word of every line of tothelighthouse.txt on its own line.

* Open TSLA.json and load its data into a variable.

Print that dictionary out.

Create a new dictionary that only has the 'companyName', 'latestPrice', and 'marketCap'  keys and their values.

Save that dictionary to a file called 'TSLAprice.json'

* Open lists.json and load its data into a variable.

For each key, print the key, the number of elements in its value, and the last element of that value.

*For exemption only* Create a new dictionary that has each key of lists.json. The value should itself be a dictionary with two keys. 'length' with the length of the corresponding list, and 'max' with the max value of that list. Save that dictionary to a new json file.

```
{
    'F': {
        'length': 6,
        'max': 92
    },
    'D': {
        'length': 5,
        'max': 97
    },
    ... etc
```

* Find the line in tothelighthouse.txt that has the most words (or one that is tied for the most words). Print that line out.
