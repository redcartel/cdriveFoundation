#### FizzBuzz

* This is a classic interview question for entry-level coding jobs.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

* So the beginning of the output will look like

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

* pt 2:

Write a second version of the program. It should input an integer from the user. Then print numbers counting *down* from that number to 1 with Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz replacing them as before.

```
Input the starting number: 15
FizzBuzz
14
13
Fizz
11
Buzz
Fizz
8
7
Fizz
Buzz
4
Fizz
2
1
```
