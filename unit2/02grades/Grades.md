## Grades

* Prompt the user to input a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive)

* If the number is less than 0 or greater than 100, print a message telling the user that is not a legitimate grade.

* Otherwise save the letter grade in a variable called 'grade'

* If the number is greater than or equal to 90 the grade is an "A"

* If the number is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90 the grade is a "B"

* If the number is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80 the grade is a "C"

* If the number is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70 the grade is a "D"

* If the number is less than 60 the grade is an "F"

* Print "Your grade is a {grade}" where "{grade}" is replaced by the value of "grade"

#### Challenges

* Have it add a + to a grade if the grade ends in a 9. (Like 89 is a "B+." Have it add a - to a grade if the grade ends in a 0 (like 60 is a "D-"

* Do the above except there is no F- or F+ and a 100 should be an A+
