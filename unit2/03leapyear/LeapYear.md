## Leap Year

#### When a year is a leap year.

* To adjust for the year not being an exact number of days, some years have an extra day, the 29th of September.

* Most of the time, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.

* A year is not a leap year if it is also divisible by 100.

* But it is a leap year if it is also divisible by 400.

2016 is a leap year.

1900 and 2100 are not a leap years.

1600 and 2000 are leap years.
