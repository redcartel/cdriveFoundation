## Python Foundations, Quiz 2

#### Answer three of the following five questions

* use the following code:

```
a = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
```

use built-in functions to do the following three operations

    1) calculate the length of the list.

    2) find the value of the list's 2nd item.

    3) add the number 64 to the end of the list (making the list one element longer).

* Input a string from a user. Then print out "The last letter of your string is: " followed by the final character that they input for the string.

```
input a string: Try this out
The last letter of your string is: t
```

* Use a slice index to make a string from "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." that is every third letter, starting from the first. It should look like "T i o xusv ea g"

* Use a for loop to print out each letter in the string "Quiz time" followed by an '!'. Extra credit: don't print a '!' after a blank space. (a ' ' character)

```
Q!
u!
i!
z!

t!
i!
m!
e!
```

* Use a for loop and a range to produce the same output as this code:

```
start = -10
stop = 50
step = 7

i = start
while i < stop:
    print(i)
    i = i + step
```
