I'm going to try a new format for lecture notes to distribute.

I'm going to write code that usees 'assert' and true statements

You don't need to use assert in your own code. It is for debugging
and testing. When you pass it a True statement, it does nothing,
if it is passed a False statement, it raises an exception.
