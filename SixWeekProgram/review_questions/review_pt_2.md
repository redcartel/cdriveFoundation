1. Open a file called output.txt in write mode. Put the text "Hello World" into it.

2. Open the file you created in problem number 1. Read its line and print out the length of the line.

3. Open a file called output.txt. Create an input loop asking for lines of text until the user inputs the word 'done.' As they enter the lines write them to the file.

4. Open the file you created in problem number 3. Read the file and build a list where each element is a string containing a line of text from the file. Extra: do not include the invisible newline character that is at the end of every line.

5. Open thisis.txt and use a for loop to print out its contents. Can you avoid extra blank lines?

6. Open thisis.txt print out each line with all of the words that are one or two letters long in CAPS.

7. Open thisis.txt. Build a list that is a list of strings, where each string is an individual word from the poem.

8. Open numbers.txt. For each row in the file, print the sum of the numbers.

9. Open numbers.txt. Print the rows in reverse order (the last row should be first, the second to last row should be second, etc.)

10. Open numbers.txt. Append a row of zeroes to the end of the file.

11. Open numbers.txt. Write an identical file called numbers2.txt.

12. Create a dictionary with one key, value pair. The key is "Hello" the value is "World". Write this file to a file called output.json

13. Open example.json, read it into a dictionary, and print out each key.

14. Open example.json, add the key "five" with the value 5 to the dictionary, and then save the dictionary over the existing example.json.

15. Open example2.json, read it into a dictionary. The values are lists. Print each key next to the first element of its corresponding list value.

16. Open example3.json, read it into a dictionary. Print the names of the students next to their student ID number for each student.

17. Open example3.json, create a new student record like the others. Her name is "kai," her studentID is 0004, and her GPA is 91.2.

18. Open example3.json, create an input loop. Until the user enters "done" ask for a student name, a studentID, and a GPA. Add them to the dictionary. After they are done inputting data, save it to a json file.

19. OPTIONAL: Use try & except block to handle input for GPA that can't convert into a float. Display an error message and then start over with student name.

20. OPTIONAL: Look up the documentation for python3's csv module. Save the grid of numbers from numbers.txt to a csv. Excel can export and import this file format, you can do interesting and useful things with it.
