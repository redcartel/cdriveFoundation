## Exercise - Pay

* Write a function ```prompt_hours()``` that prompts a user to input how many hours they have worked. It should return a float.

```
# calling your function:
hours = prompt_hours()
# produces the effect:
How many hours did you work? 45

# which stores 45.0 in the variable hours
```

* Write a similar function that prompts for the rate of pay.

* Pay is the hourly rate for the first 40 hours and 1.5 times the rate for time over that.

* Write another function ```compute(hours, rate)``` that computes total pay given a number of hours worked. It should return a float.

* Use these functions together to complete the program that asks a user for pay and rate and computes their paycheck.
