## Conversion

* Copy the following code into a python file:

```python

from random import randint

numberlist = []

for i in range(10):
    numberlist.append(randint(0,99))

print(numberlist)

```

* Using a for in loop, find the sum of the list and print it out.

* Create a new list that is every element of the first list doubled.

* Print the elements of the list that are greater than 40

* Create a new list that is every element converted into a string.

```str(x)``` will convert a variable x into a string
