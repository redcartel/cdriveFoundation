## Caesar

* Julius Caesar used a simple code to send messages to his subordinates. He would shift each letter in a message a certain number of letters forward in the alphabet. For instance if that number was 2, then "VICE" would be "XKEG." If a letter would go past the end of the alphabet, it loops back around, so Y would become A with a shift of 2.

* Write a program that asks the user for a message and an integer shift value.

* Print out the encoded message. Keep characters other than letters the same.

* Look up ord() and chr(), functions that convert single-character strings to the number corresponding to the letter and then back again.

* Allow negative integer input to decrypt, so giving a shift value of -5 would decrypt a message encoded with a shift value of 5.
