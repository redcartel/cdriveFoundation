## Number Grid

* Write a program that prints 10 lines, where each line has 10 numbers on it so that the numbers go
from 0 to 99.

* One way to do this is with a for loop inside of another for loop

* Another way to do this is to use % to figure out when to print a newline character.

* Remember the end="" parameter to make print not go to a new line

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 ...
...
```

* and so on.
