## Formatting and documentation.

* This is an exercise in string formatting but also in reading documentation!

[https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html] has the documentation for how .format works. Scroll down to "Format String Syntax"

* Trial and error are your friends. A whole lot of the job of coding is learning how to learn from documentation and online Q&A answers.

* You might also want to search questions and answers at the website [stackoverflow.com] - it's every programmer's best friend. When you look at Stackoverflow answers, check the date on the questions and answers, make sure they're from the last 3 or 4 years. Not too long ago Python moved from version 2 to version 3 and some things have changed.

#### The exercise:

* You will use the interactive python environment to figure out the answers to these problems, but save the commands into a .py file to turn in for the assignment.

* Store 3 and 'little pigs' in two variables. Print the string "The 3 little pigs" by inserting those two variables into a format string.

* Store the number 6.7 in a variable, then make it print as 6.700 when it is given to the format() function.

* Store "Nikil" and "Josephine" into two variables, then print

```
Look at [Nikil          ] now.
Look at [Josephine      ] now.
```

With the same print & format statement, just with the variables changed. That's 15 characters between the braces for both outputs.

* Now print

```
Look at [          Nikil] now.
Look at [      Josephine] now.
```

Once again, using the same print statement.
