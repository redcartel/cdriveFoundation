## Python Foundation Day 7 Quiz

#### Answer three of the following five problems:

* Write a function that takes two strings as its arguments and returns the longer of the two strings.

* Write a program with a global variable called "total" and then write two functions called "increase" and "decrease." One should increase total by 1, the other should decrease it by 1. (remember the 'global' keyword, google it if you need to)

* Write a function that puts a ! on both sides of a string. ("Quiz" becomes "!Quiz!"). Then use this code:

```
stringlist = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]
```

Using a loop, build a new list that has the result of your function applied to each of those values

```
["!one!", "!two!", "!three!", "!four!", "!five!"]
```

* Write a program that counts the total number of words in sonnet.txt 

* Write a program that outputs the numbers from 10 to 20 to a text file called output.txt. There should be one number on each line.
