## General Python

```
# print(value)

# print with zero or multiple arguments

# converting strings to integers and floats

# finding the length of a string

# % to test divisibility

# // to find whole number division without remainder

# in to test if a short string is contained within a long one

# if elif and else

# and, or, not, in, not in, ==, <, >, <=, >=

# for i in range(max)

# range(min, max, step)

# while True ... break for input loop

# building a string starting with an empty string "" and a loop using +

# building a list starting with an empty list [] and a loop using append

# for element in list

# list pop

# import random, random.randint(min, max)

# using .split() to split a sentence into a list of words

# .upper() .lower()

# ", ".join(stringlist) " ".join(stringlist) "".join(stringlist) etc.

# slices of lists and strings collections[start:stop:step], negative values for stop or step

# reading values from a dictionary and assigning values to a dictionary with dictionary[key] and dictionary[key] = value

# test if a key is in a dictionary with in

# for key in dictionary, using dictionary[key] in that loop to get the values

# accessing elements from a dictionary or a list that is inside a dictionary with d[key][index]

```

## File I/O

```
# file_object open("filename", "r")

# for line in file_object

# split each line of a file into words to do something

# transform each line of a file with a function you write

# output each line of a file to the terminal without extra blank lines

# output each line of a file to a new file

# output each line of a file after being processed by some function to the terminal or to a new file

# read input from a while / input loop and save the user's input to a file

# save each line of a file to a list to do some operation that requires access to all of the lines at one time

# file_object = open("filename", "w")

# using print(string, file=file_object) to add text to a file

# where to place the open statement in a loop that is outputting data to a file

# what happens to existing data when a file is opened in "w" mode

# file_object = open("filename", "a")

# adding text to the end of an existing file

# import json

# dictionary data is almost always saved to and read from .json files

# data = json.load(file_object)

# json.dump(data, file_object)

# reading a dictionary from json data, modifying the dictionary, then saving over the existing json file

```
