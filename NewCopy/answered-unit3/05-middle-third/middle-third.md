## Middle Third

* Write a program that gets a string input from a user and then prints how many characters long the string is and then prints the middle third of it.

* For instance

```
Input a string: Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country
68
l good men to come to 
```

* Hint: you will want to calculate the start and stop values of a slice index ```[start:stop]```
