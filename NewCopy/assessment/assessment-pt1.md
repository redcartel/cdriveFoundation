## Assessment, Pt. 1

Answer 3 of the following questions:

If you are attempting to exempt the Byte Academy entrance requirements, you must answer the final question.

* Write a program that prompts the user for three floating point numbers. It should add the first two together, and then mulitply the sum by the third number. Print the result formatted so it has three digits after the decimal place (such as 32.050)

```
Input a number: 5
Input a number: 15
Input a number: 0.5

The result is 10.000
```

* Write a program that prompts the user for a string. It should calculate the length of that string and then the number of times 5 divides that length evenly, as well as the remainder after the division.

```
Input a string: Example answer

5 goes into the length 2 times with a remainder of 4
```

* Print the numbers from 0 to 50 with the multiples of 7 left out.

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
8
9
...
```

* Input a string from the user.

There are two tests: If the first letter of the string is a vowel, and if the string is 20 or more characters long.

If both tests are true, print "Both tests passed."

If only one tests are true, print "One of the tests passed."

If neither test is true, print "Both tests failed."


* Using one or two for loops, print out the letters of the alphabet in two rows of 13. Use the fact that chr(65) = 'A', chr(66) = 'B' etc.

```
A B C D E F G H I J K L M 
N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```
