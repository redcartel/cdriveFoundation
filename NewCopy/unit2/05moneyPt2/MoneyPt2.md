## Money problem Part 2

* Let's add some features to the correct change calculator from unit 1.

* Make it so it doesn't print a line if there are 0 of that bill or coin.

* Make it so it prints the plural of a bill or coin if there are more than one and the singular if there is only one.

* For instance

```
How much money do you have? 40.81

You have 2 twenty dollar bills.
You have 3 quarters.
You have 1 nickel.
You have 1 penny.
```

* Challenge:

```
quantities = ("hundred dollar bill", "fifty dollar bill", "twenty dollar bill", "ten dollar bill", "five dollar bill", "one dollar bill", "quarter", "dime", "nickel", "penny")

quantities_plural = ("hundred dollar bills", "fifty dollar bills", "twenty dollar bills", "ten dollar bills", "five dollar bills", "one dollar bills", "quarters", "dimes", "nickels", "pennies")

values = (10000, 5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 25, 10, 5, 1)
```

With this code, can you simplify the solution to this problem so that the same code uses the same logic for each denomination of currency?
