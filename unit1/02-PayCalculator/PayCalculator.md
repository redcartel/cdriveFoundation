## Expressions Challenge

* Look up the documentation for input() if you need to. Remember how to convert a string of a number into a number?

* Write a program to prompt the user for hours worked and hourly wage and then display the user's gross pay. Gross pay = hours * wage.

* Use 35 hours and a rate of 11.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 402.5)

* Can you print the output in this format?

```
"35 hours at $11.50 per hour is $402.50."
```

instead of just printing the number?
