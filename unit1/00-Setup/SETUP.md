## Setup

* Sign up for an account on discordapp.com

* We ask that you use your first name in your profile. If you need to set up a dummy account just for this class so as not to mess with your regular one, that's OK.

* Kai will email you the invitation to our channel.

* Download and install python 3.7 from python.org. 32 bit or 64 bit doesn't matter.

* Make sure that you can launch IDLE.

* When IDLE launches, you should see ```Python 3.6.0``` or greater mentioned.

* Download typora from typora.io

* Use typora to read the .md files in this class.

* Bookmark https://automatetheboringstuff.com

* Create a new folder in your Documents or on your Desktop called "Byte"

* Create a new file in IDLE

* Type in

```
print("hello world")
```

* Select run > run module from the menu. It will ask you to save the file. Save it as hello.py in your Byte folder.

* You should see the text "hello world" in a new window.


## VS Code

* VS Code is a more powerful editor than IDLE, it will help you find bugs and it will suggest the names of functions.

* Download it from [http://code.visualstudio.com].

* After installing, launch VSCode

* Go to View > Extensions in the menu

* Search for the "Python" extension from Microsoft and install it.

* To work with a folder of python files you will go to file > Open Folder (just file > Open on Mac) and open that folder.

* Create a new file and save it as hello.py. Put a print() statement in it.

* Right click the file and select "Run Python file in terminal"

* You should see the results of your code.
