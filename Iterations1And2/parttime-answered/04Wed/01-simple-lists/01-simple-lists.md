## Simple Lists

* Prompt the user for an input string. Repeat the prompt if the string is shorter than 10 characters.

* Convert the string into a list.

* Print the list of letters.

* Print the length of the list.

* Print a sorted version of the list without changing the saved list. Look up sort() vs. sorted().

* Add the character '!' as a new element to the list.

* Print the number of times the ' ' (space) character is in the list.

* Use a slice to print every other character.

* Remove the last element of the list and store it in a new variable.

* Insert that value at the beginning of the list (position zero) with insert()
