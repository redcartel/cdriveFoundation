## Conversion

* Copy the following code into a python file:

```python

from random import randint

numberlist = []

for i in range(10):
    numberlist.append(random.randint(0,99))

print(numberlist)

```

* Find the sum of the list and print it out. (Don't use the built-in sum function)

* Create a new list that is every element of the first list doubled.

* Print the elements of the list that are greater than 40

* Create a new list that is every element converted into a string.

```str(x)``` will convert a variable x into a string

* Use join create a string that is all the numbers separated by a comma and a space.

```
17, 82, 57, 68, 48, 98, 3, 74, 27, 96
```

#### Challenge:

* Look up "List Comprehensions" write the conversion of the integers into strings using a list comprehension.
