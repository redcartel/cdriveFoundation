## Basic Conditionals

#### Do the following in a single program

* Use input() to prompt the user to enter an integer and use int() to convert the string to an integer value. Store the result in a variable.

* If the number is equal to zero, print "It is zero!" If it is not, print "It's not zero!"

* If the number is less than 10 print "Less than 10!" If not but it's less than 20 print "Less than 20!" Otherwise, print "Big number you got there!" Use one 'if' one 'elif' and one 'else.'

* If the number is greater than or equal to 10 and less than but not equal to 100, print "Two digits!"

* If the number is even print "It is even!"

* If the number is divisible by 5 (number % 5 == 0) print "It is divisible by five!"

* If a number is divisible by 13 or it is divisible by 17, print "Cicadas!"

* If the number is both even and divisible by 9 print "It is both even and divisible by 9!" (Don't just check for divisibility by 18)

* If the number is not divisible by seven, update the variable by multiplying it by 7. Otherwise divide it by 7. After updating the number, print "The new number is <number> now."

* Test your code by running it and providing different inputs.
