---

#### Description

A palindrome is a word OR phrase that can be spelled the same way forwards and backwards.  For example, the following words and phrases are all palindromes

* "a car a man a maraca"
* "Kayak"
* "Racecar"

#### Objective

* Write a function that takes a string as an input. If it is a palindrome return True if it is not, return False.

* You may use a list and any built in functions you find might help

* Write a function that takes a filename as an input. It reads a text file and for each line, it prints out the line followed by "this line is a palindrome" or "this line is not a palindrome"
