## Student Record

* Write a program that prompts the user for an input giving two options:

```
1 - Input student grade
2 - Grade averages
```

* If the user selects option 1, prompt the user for a student name followed by a test grade (a float between 0.0 and 100.0)

```
Student name: Carter Adams
Test grade: 71.5
```

* Keep a running file that stores all grades, after prompting for the name and grade, add the new information to the running file.

* There are several ways of organizing the file. It's up to you.

* You can either exit the program after a prompt or loop back to the main menu.

* If the user selects option 2, print a list of all the students' averages:

```
Carter Adams: 79.0
Greg Smith: 90.1
Rak Chugh: 100.0
```
