## Thinking Python

The excellent book, Think Python is available for free online. It organizes its material differently than we do our curriculum but seeing ideas more than one time is a good way to really learn them.

* Try to read the first chapter. 'The Way of the Program.'

* Turn in the answers to the exercises with your coding work.
