## Number Grid

* Write a program that prints 10 lines, where each line has 10 numbers on it so that the numbers go
from 0 to 99.

* Remember the end= parameter for print

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12...
```

* and so on.

### Challenge problem:

* Accept an integer input. Make a grid of the numbers from 0 to 1 less than that number. Try to make your grid a proper rectangle with no uneven remainder row.

For instance an input of 12 might produce:

```
0  1  2  3
4  5  6  7
8  9 10 11
```
