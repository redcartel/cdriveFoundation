## Formatting and documentation.

* This is an exercise in string formatting but also in reading documentation!

[https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html] has the documentation for how .format works.

* You might also want to search questions and answers at the website [stackoverflow.com] - it's every programmer's best friend. When you look at Stackoverflow answers, check the date on the questions and answers, make sure they're from the last 3 or 4 years. Not too long ago Python moved from version 2 to version 3 and some things have changed.

#### The exercise:

* You will use the interactive python environment to figure out the answers to these problems, but save the commands into a .py file to turn in for the assignment.

* Store 3 and 'little pigs' in two variables. Print the string "The 3 little pigs" using those 2 variables.

* Store the number 6.7 in a variable, then make it print as 6.700 (use a formatting option inside of {} braces)

* Store the strings "Sam" and "Josephine" into variables. Print the text

```
The joint account for Sam          and Josephine    has $1000.
``` 

* Where there are 13 characters between the first letter of each name and the next word.

* Now display the same output but with the extra spaces before the names instead.

* Using the ```*``` operator with a string and a number, print 80 ```#```s in a row.
